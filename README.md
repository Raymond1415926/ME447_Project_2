# ME447_Project_2
This is a class project which we need to implement a numerical solver for soft and slender rods.
If you want to run the snake, go to cosserat_rod.py and call the run_snake function.
If you want to run CMAes for optimization on the snake, go to CMA.py and run the script.
If you want to see other cases, you can uncomment the cases in cosserat_rod.py and see the simulations.
Have fun!
